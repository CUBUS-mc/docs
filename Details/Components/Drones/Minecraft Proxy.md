Drones that are mc proxies act as proxy between a client and a server. They broadcast their IP when they are avoidable over a message DB. 
Purpose: 
- Offer protection for client and server, because real IP is never shown to each other (Server knows only proxy IP and username and client only server ID)
- Add features:
	- Commands like /tp (short distances only)
	- Translate chat
	- Change weather client side w/o mods
	- Freecam w/o mods
	- Anti-Anti-Cheat (normalize coordinates, send onGround packet)
- Enforce [[Terms of Service]] (e.g. don't allow placing TnT)
